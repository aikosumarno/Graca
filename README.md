On November 4th 2023, 3 friends and I joined a UI/UX design competition called UXplore that UBC Biztech hosted. 
Within 3h 30min, we had to come up with a pitch for a product with a thorough business plan and prototype. 
Together, we came up with an idea on how we can make Gacha machines more educational. 
As one of the two UX designers in the team, we created a prototype of an educational application where students can answer quizzes, level up, and collect exclusive characters. 
Students can enrol in the courses they want, and finishing the quizzes would allow them to collect points to redeem a Gacha. 
They can also compete with their friends through the leaderboard and share their results.
